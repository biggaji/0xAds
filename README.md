# 0xAds

Basic platform Ads server implementation in Node.js.

I built it using TypeScript, GraphQL, PostgresQL, and Prisma.

I used Docker for containalization and deployment.

It handles basic functionalities required to create an Ad such as:

- Creating an Ad campaign
- Fetching Ad campaign(s)
- Updating an Ad campaign
- Deleting an Ad campaign
- Activating and De-activate an Ad campaign
- Authenticating only via [Oxhut](https://github.com/biggaji/0xhut)

I used my [Oxhut](https://github.com/biggaji/0xhut) server to handle authentication and authorization.

I will add more notes I progress. Still under development.

Thank you for stopping by. Happy coding!
